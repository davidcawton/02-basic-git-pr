    <p> Hi, my name is David Cawton, and I am working with The Iron Yard to become a Front-End Web Developer.
      For the past two years I've been working in broadacst news as a reporter and anchor, but recently decided
      to find a new career. While news was great, I didn't have the passion for it, and I found my creativity dwindling.
      I have always been interested in how the web works and more importantly how it can be harnessed to create great things. I have some experience
      working with HTML and CSS, but JavaScript and Git for that matter are new for me. I'm confident that the next 12-weeks will change my life for the better!
      You can keep up with my work on GitHub! </br>
      Thanks for checking my page out!</p>
