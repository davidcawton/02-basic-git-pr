    <p> Hi, my name is David Cawton, and I am working with The Iron Yard to become a Front-End Web Developer. </br>
      For the past two years I've been working in broadacst news as a reporter and anchor, but recently decided </br>
      to find a new career. While news was great, I didn't have the passion for it, and I found my creativity dwindling.</br>
      I have always been interested in how the web works and more importantly how it can be harnessed to create great things. </br>
      I'd love to connect with you on Twitter, LinkedIn and GitHub. Those links are below. Thanks for checking my page out!</p>
